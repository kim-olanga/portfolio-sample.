                <p><strong>My name is Kimberly Olanga</strong><em>I was a student at the Cooperative University of Kenya.</em>I was pursuing Project Management at Diplpma level.I got the opportunity to work for the Nairobi City County under the fire depertment immediately after Internship.Honestly I never thought of myself doing programming,but the opportunity came knocking at my door through a great friend.So far I am enjoying the process simply because one of my favourite intrests is going out for challenges and programming for a pure beginner is quite challenging.Some of my other hobbies include,balling thatbis basketball, reading,singing and once in a while I try dancing. Through some of these hobbies escpecially when it comes to music,i have been able to learn a few skills like,paying attention,I play the violin and it takes a lot of attention and patience to learn it and thats why I  believe I can hack through programming.I am a very jolly and playful lady, very easy to talk to and approach and confide in simply because I know how keep to myself a lot of information.</p>
